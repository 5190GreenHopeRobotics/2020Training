Getting Started
===============

Welcome to Team 5190's Training! Before you dive deep into robot code, we recommend that you learn the Kotlin programming language first! 
`Here <https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html>`_ is a good resource to learn the Kotlin programming language.

Setting Up Your Development Environment
---------------------------------------

In order to efficiently develop software for the team, we recommend specific tools that you should install. These tools are all free and available on any operating system. 
If you are on a Linux-based operating system, you can use a package manager to install Git, Python, and the JDK.

 - `Git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_
 - `Java Development Kit 11 (JDK 11) <https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html>`_
 - `IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/>`_
 - `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_

Uninstall older versions of the above tools, if you have them, before installing the newer versions. In the python installer, select the option to add Python to the path. For the rest of the installers, you can simply use the defaults on each step.

Setting Up Your FRC Driver Station
----------------------------------

To test your robot, you need a driver station. This is only available for Windows.
