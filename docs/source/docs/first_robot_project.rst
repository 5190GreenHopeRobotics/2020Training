Your First Robot Project
========================

Let's now create your first robot project. All robot projects use a build system called `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`_. 
This build system allows us to retrieve dependencies from any online source. For example, if we wanted to use Team 254's library, we can simply add it with one line to the
``build.gradle`` instead of having to download it manually.

Furthermore, we can package and deploy all of our robot code to the robot with one task.

Overview of RobotTemplate
-------------------------

``RobotTemplate`` is a repository created by Team 5190 that contains the basic template for every robot that we program. A link to this repository is available `here <https://github.com/5190GreenHopeRobotics/RobotTemplate>`_. 

Cloning RobotTemplate
---------------------

We will now use Git to "clone" this repository onto your local computer. When you clone a repository, you create a local copy of it on your computer. Throughout your programming career at Team 5190, you will extensively use the command line. You should start to feel comfortable using the command line.

Open a terminal window of your choice (PowerShell, Terminal, iTerm, etc.) and ``cd`` to the directory where you wish to clone the project. Then run the following command:

``git clone https://github.com/5190GreenHopeRobotics/RobotTemplate``

This will create a copy of the robot template project. You can ``cd`` into ``RobotTemplate`` and see its contents:
