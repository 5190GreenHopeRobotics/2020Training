# 1. Setup

Welcome to the training repository for FRC 5190. This course will contain several modules In this first module, you will setup your development environment.

In order to efficiently develop software for the team, we recommend specific tools to download. At Team 5190, we use the Kotlin programming language. Before you dive into robot code (the objective for this repository of training), we **highly** recommend that you learn Kotlin first. [Here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html) is a good resource.

## Robot Development Tools

Please download the following:
 1. [Java Development Kit 11 (JDK 11)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html)
 1. [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
 1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

As an alternative, if you are on a Linux machine, you can use a package manager to install Python and the JDK.
