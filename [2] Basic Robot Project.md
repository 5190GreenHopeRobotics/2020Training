# 2. Basic Robot Project

Let's get started with our first robot project. Open a terminal window in a location where you want your project located. Run the command below to clone the basic robot template repository:

`git clone https://github.com/5190GreenHopeRobotics/RobotTemplate`

When you clone a repository using Git, you are creating a local copy of the repository on the GitHub page of the team. You can edit this local copy as much as you wish.

## Opening your new project in IntelliJ

IntelliJ IDEA is the name of the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that we use to develop robot code. Let's first open this project in IntelliJ:

 1. Open IntelliJ. If this is the first time using IntelliJ, it will ask you for your theme preferences, etc. Choose what you think is best for you (dark theme).
 1. Click the `Open` button. Navigate to the location where you cloned the basic robot project template. Click on the folder called `RobotTemplate`. 
 1. A window with "Gradle" preferences should pop up. Choose the default options and continue.
