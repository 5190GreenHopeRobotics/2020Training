    - How many repositories do you see here?
    - Which repository do you think contains the code for 2019 competition robot?
    - What repository is this training material in?

3. Install Git on your machine. Search for `Git for windows` or `Git for mac`.

5. Clone the `2020Training` repository to your machine. Using VS code browse through the files of this repository on your local machine.

6. Create a new branch called `teams/<your-team-name>` in this repository on your local machine.

7. Add a new file called `docs/<your-team-name>.md`. Add a description of your team, the names of your team members, and an explanation of what you know in programming to this file.

8. Push your branch to the GitHub repository.

9. Create a pull request to merge the contents of your branch to master.

10. Come and show off your work at the build space.
