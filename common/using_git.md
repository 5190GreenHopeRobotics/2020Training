    - File
    - Clone

2. Our team stores all the repositories here: https://github.com/frc5190. Answer the following questions:
    - How many repositories do you see here?

    - What repository is this training material in?

3. Install Git on your machine. Search for `Git for windows` or `Git for mac`.

8. Push your branch to the GitHub repository.

9. Create a pull request to merge the contents of your branch to master.
