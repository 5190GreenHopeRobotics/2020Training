# calculator Program

In this project, you will learn how to write various methods to perform certain algebraic tasks. You will learn how to call and implement methods within the same class as well as how to call methods from a different class.

## Prerequisites

Hello World program (130)

## Instructions

1. Create a new project called `calculator Program` and a new Kotlin file within your project. Name the file `calculator`.
Create your `calculator.calculator.main` method.
3. Create four new methods within your file that will compute and return the calculator.calculator.sum, difference, calculator.product, and quotient of two numbers passed to them.
4. Initialize two variables in your `calculator.calculator.main` method and send them to each of the methods. In the `calculator.calculator.main` method, print the return value of each method.
5. Create a new method that will convert inches to feet. The method should return a string stating the total amount of feet as well as the leftover inches based on the value that you passed to it. Call this method in your `calculator.calculator.main` method and print the result.
6. Once you get everything to work, create a new Kotlin class in your source folder. Name it `Perform`. Now move a copy of all your methods (other than the `calculator.calculator.main` method) from your `calculator` file to the new class.
7. Now in the `calculator` file, call each of the five methods using the `Perform` class istead of from your `calculator` file. In the `calculator.calculator.main` method, make sure you still print the return of each of the five methods.
8. Come show off your work!
