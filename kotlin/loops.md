# Loops

In this project, you will practice writing for loops, while loops, and forEach statements. 

## Prerequisites

Hello World program (130) and Calculator program(230)

## Instructions

1. Create a new project called `Loops` and a new Kotlin file within your project. Name the file `main`.
Create your `main` method.
3. Create a new Koltin class within your project and name it `loops`. Within your class, create an initializing constructor that will print `initialize`
4. Now (outside of the constructor), create a method called `basicForLoops`. Write a four seperate for loops that will...    
    - print variable x in 0-10 inclusive
    - print variable x in 0-10 not inlusive of 10
    - print variable x in 0-10 inclusive skipping every other number
    - print variable x in 10-0 inclusive skipping every other number
5. Now (outside of the constructor), create a method called `forLoops`. Write a two seperate for loops.    
    - For the first one, declare a list called `colors` of three string elements. Using a for loop, print each element in the list.
    - Next, create a new for loop that will iterate through the index and value of each element in `colors`. In the body of your loop, print the index and value in one line.
6. Once you get everything to work, create a new Kotlin class in your source folder. Name it `Perform`. Now move a copy of all your methods (other than the `main` method) from your `Calculator` file to the new class.
7. Now in the `Calculator` file, call each of the five methods using the `Perform` class istead of from your `Calculator` file. In the `main` method, make sure you still print the return of each of the five methods.
8. Come show off your work!
