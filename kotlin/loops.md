# Loops

In this project, you will practice writing for loops, while loops, and forEach statements. 

## Prerequisites

Hello World program (130) and Calculator program (230)

## Instructions

1. Create a new project called `Loops` and a new Kotlin file within your project. Name the file `main`.
Create your `main` method.
1. Create a new Koltin class within your project and name it `loops`. 
2. Create a method called `basicForLoops`. Write four seperate for loops that will...    
    - print variable x in 0-10 inclusive
    - print variable x in 0-10 not inlusive of 10
    - print variable x in 0-10 inclusive skipping every other number
    - print variable x in 10-0 inclusive skipping every other number
3. Create a method called `forLoops`. Write two seperate for loops.    
    - For the first one, declare a list called `colors` of three string elements. Using a for loop, print each element in the list.
    - Next, create a new for loop that will iterate through the index and value of each element in `colors`. In the body of your loop, print the index and value in one line.
4. Create a method called `whileLoop`. In your method declare an integer variable named `x` set to 0. Set your loop so that it prints the value of `x` while `x` is less than 10. Remember to increase `x` by 1 in the body of the loop. 
5. Create a method called `forEachStatement`. In your method create a list of two string elements and using a forEach statement, print each of the strings.
6. Create a method called `delay`. Add two print statements and add code for a 2 second delay between the statements.
7. At the top of your `loops` class, add an initializing constructor that prints `initialized`
8.  Go back to the file with your `main` method and create an object from your `loops` class. Then call each of the methods from the `loops` class using the object you created.
9.  Come show off your work!
